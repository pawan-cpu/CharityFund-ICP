# CharityFund on ICP

# Inspiration
- We believe that direct human-to-human interactions and are at the core of what makes decentralized technology valuable.

- Online user-to-user interactions have come to be rely almost exclusively on centralized intermediaries.

- It should be easy for blockchain application developers to facilitate secure hear-to-heart connections.

- At Chainfund crowdfunding dapp we understand the importance of fostering meaningful connections and providing a safe and secure platform for users.

- Let's come together and make a positive impact on homelessness by building a supportive community through our dapp.

## What it does
- Our homeless charityfunding dapp, powered by CharityFund's community model, helps reduce homelessness by supporting people in finding jobs and homes that lift them out of homelessness for good.
- 
- We accomplish this by providing each person with a dedicated caseworker who connects them with a supportive online community that provides funding and mentorship. Our dapp is designed to encourage community support and incentivize funding through our economic incentive model.
- 
- We also match our community members with forward-thinking employers and landlords who share our commitment to reducing homelessness. 
- 
- Our dapp's primary goal is to provide a safe and secure platform where people can connect and come together to make a positive impact on homelessness.



## How we built it
- Traditional crowdfunding platforms are often centralized and charge high fees.

- Our decentralized crowdfunding platform uses ICP blockchain's Definity Network to help the homeless. We are using cutting-edge technology to make charitable donations more efficient and transparent than ever before.

- By utilizing the Dfinity network, we are able to minimize transaction fees and ensure that donations go directly towards providing vocational training for the homeless.

# Accomplishments that we're proud of
